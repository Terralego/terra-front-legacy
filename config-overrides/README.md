# Config override

This directory contains configuration files used by [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)
to alter default Webpack & Jest configuration provided by
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- [`index.js`](./index.js) is the entry point linking to :
  - [`webpack.js`](./webpack.js) which alters Webpack configuration,
  - [`jest.js`](./jest.js) alters Jest configuration.
- [`settings.js`](./settings.js) stores the values shared by the two previous
  files.
- [`less-overrides.less`](./less-overrides.less) allows defining variables
  for less CSS preprocessor.
